# ApproXtsp

**ApproXtsp** is a program that compares results of different algorithms of the Travelling Salesman Problem.

### Algorithms
- Nearest Neighbour
- Approx Tsp Tour
- "Multi" Approx Tsp Tour - runs Approx Tsp Tour from every vertex and gives the best result 

### Features
- Data generator
- Showing the path and its length
- Loading data from a file
- Saving results to a file

### Data
Input file has to have in the first line a information how many lines are in the file.

At the end of the file should be not "EOF".

Files should have _.txt_ extension.

Right format of _ulysses16_:
```
